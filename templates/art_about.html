      <h4>Ed Leafe – Photography</h4>

    <div class="row">
        Photography is my creative outlet. I don't do studio work, weddings, portraits, or photojournalism (although I do take a lot of selfies with family!)

        I subscribe to the philosophy that <b>the best camera is the one you have with you</b>. I prefer to travel light, so my primary camera is an <a href="https://www.getolympus.com/us/en/e-m10-mark-ii.html" target="_new">Olympus Micro Four-Thirds</a>, and my secondary camera is my iPhone. I don't believe that an expensive camera takes better photographs except in a few extreme use cases. So I encourage everyone to use what they have instead of lusting over the newest shiniest device.

        My preferred medium for display is a digital display – I feel that it affords a range of luminosity that a print simply cannot match. To that end, I have created digital display software with the ability to control the displayed image as well as change it on a determined schedule. Ask me about it if you're interested.
